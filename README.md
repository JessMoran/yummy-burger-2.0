# Yummy Burger

 Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
 Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display the burger on the top side of the page, waiting to be devoured.
 Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the left side of the page.
